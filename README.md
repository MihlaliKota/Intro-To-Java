# Intro-To-Java

## What is Java?
----------------

Java is commonly used by newcomers in programming to interact with computers. Software engineers use Java to develop a variety of applications like web, mobile, and desktop apps. These programs require the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) to run, and for creating and compiling Java programs, the Java Development Kit (JDK) is essential, which includes the JRE and necessary tools.

- Writing and running Java programs

## Algorithms in Programming
----------------------------

Computers are present in various aspects of our lives but require specific instructions (programs) to function. While early programs were written in binary code, programmers have created programming languages like Java to simplify the process. These languages are converted into binary code that the computer can understand. Algorithms, which provide step-by-step guides for computers to follow, are essential for solving problems using programming languages.

- Various programming languages

To give you an example, think about figuring out how much money an employee makes before deductions. We can create a step-by-step approach for this. Start by finding out how many hours they have worked and then check their hourly wage rate. Next, you multiply those hours by their rate and show the answer. Once you have got this down, you can use a programming language like Java to make it work in real life.
